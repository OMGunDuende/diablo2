What is charinfo?
	A small utility that prints a list of all characters found in the pvpgn charsave directory.
	It reads the level, class and status (dead or alive) and prints it.

Why?
	I wrote it so I can easily parse a charlist with php to integrate into a website. It would have been
	a pain in the ass to parse the binary coded charfiles with php, so I call this C program periodically with
	cron and write the result to a place my php script can read it.

How do I set it up?
	Just change the two DEFINEs in the .c file to your directory and compile it using "make".
